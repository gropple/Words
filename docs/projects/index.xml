      <description>This desktop widget lets you control the web-based Google Play Music without having to hunt around for the right browser tab.
The widget is coded in Scala and uses ScalaFX for the UI. There&amp;rsquo;s also a Chrome extension, written in Javascript, which interacts with Google Play Music. IPC between the two is with Websockets.
GitHub hosts the Chrome extension source and desktop widget source.</description>

      <description>CParser on github is my library that turns valid C code into a clean abstract syntax tree (AST), and can be embedded in any JVM-language project.
This could be useful for e.g. a JVM-based C compiler, transpiler, prettifier, or IDE plugin.
The code is written in Scala and transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS so it can be embedded directly here:</description>

      <title>This Personal Site</title>

      <description>This site is coded with the static site generator Hugo.
Having used Wordpress for blogging duties in the past, I&amp;rsquo;m a big convert to static site generators. They&amp;rsquo;re much faster, both for adding and consuming content.
The source is on Github and it&amp;rsquo;s hosted on Git Pages.</description>

      <description>Undiscovered Guide is a travel website I created with my partner while we were travelling, to help others explore our favourite parts of the world. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty popular, getting over 30,000 monthly page views.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on under the hood:
 Parts of it are a dynamically-created single page app. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Scala, transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS. The backend CMS is custom and written from scratch in Scala.</description>
