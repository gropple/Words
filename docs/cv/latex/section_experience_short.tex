%                       \begin{itemize}
% \item Since early 2014 I have been taking a career break. Wanting to branch out from C++, I took an opportunity to both travel and find a language that better fit my goals of producing readable and well-tested code, quickly. Plus, to try out some ideas for commercial projects.

% \item I have used the time productively to learn mainly Scala, Java and web development, plus Spring Boot, Grails, Groovy, Typescript, and multiple other technologies.  I've put together \link{https://programmatix.github.io/Words/projects/}{a demo site} to show the more interesting projects written in this time, please check it out.

% %                       \begin{itemize}
% %                         \item Completed major project to rearchitect and rebuild the most-run Bloomberg function.  It displays a condensed set of key info about stocks and is run 10+ million times daily.  Designed and built a highly optimised low latency C++ backend to handle the load, to replace the previous Fortran system, together with an efficient Javascript UI.  Delivered on schedule and with great feedback from clients (including the mayor of New York).  This was a 2 person project and I was responsible for 80\% of it.
% %                         \item Architected and built a highly performant, highly optimised C++ multithreaded backend on UNIX, to process millions of trades daily from 40 equity exchanges in realtime.  Made key architecture decisions early that gave huge wins in performance and time to deployment, particularly the use of skiplists as the central data structure.  Also architected and built the complex Javascript UI, which gets run over 25k times daily.
% %                         \item Project managed a team of 12 and was one of two lead architects and developers in a major initiative to rebuild and integrate multiple legacy trading systems into a new microservices system, involving around 10 complex C++ backends handling millions of trades in real-time over a shared bus, plus multiple accompanying UIs in Javascript.  Project was ongoing when I left, and was on-schedule and already getting great results and feedback.
% %                         \item Extensive experience with both monoliths (2GB executables) and microservices.  Bloomberg has a build-it/run-it philosophy, so teams take full ownership of their products including effectively 24/7 support.                        
% %                         \item Mentored junior programmers and was a UX Rep, helping other teams with their UIs.

% %                         \item Worked on flagship product ApplianX, a turnkey Linux-based telecomms product that used a multithreaded C++ \& Python engine to handle multiple channels of speech and fax across VoIP and regular calls.  Strongly test-driven development and focus on multi-threading and optimisation.
