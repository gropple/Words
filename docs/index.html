  A simple immutable library for vector and matrix maths, written in Scala. There&rsquo;s a surprising lack of these, with the existing Scala matrix libraries being heavyweight, rather complex, and generally part of a much large statistical package. I wanted something lightweight for 3D maths.
It&rsquo;s designed to be very safe, concise, and easy to use:
 val m1 = Matrix4x4.identity val m2 = Matrix4x4.scale(1.0f) val m3 = Matrix4x4.rotateAroundXAxis(30.0f) val m4: Matrix4x4 = m3 * m2 * m1 val v1 = Vector4(0.

  The web-based Google Play Music is great, but I was forever having to find the right browser tab just to change or like a song. So I wrote this desktop widget to be able to control my music easily without needing to go to the browser. It has two parts:
 Chrome extension: Written in Javascript, this is what interfaces with the Google Play Music tab. Source on Github. App: This widget runs on the user&rsquo;s desktop and is coded in Scala and uses ScalaFX for the UI, and Spring Boot to make a small Websockets server.

  An Android app, written in Scala and published on the Google Play Store.
This app&rsquo;s not going to win any design or complexity awards, but was more of a successful hobby project to learn Android development and publish an app in a few days.
The source is on Github.

  CParser on github is my library that turns valid C code into a clean abstract syntax tree (AST), and can be embedded in any JVM-language project.
This could be useful for e.g. a JVM-based C compiler, transpiler, prettifier, or IDE plugin.
The code is written in Scala and transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS so it can be embedded directly here:

  Undiscovered Guide Undiscovered Guide is a travel website I created with my partner while we were travelling, to help others explore our favourite parts of the world. It&rsquo;s pretty popular, getting over 30,000 monthly page views.
It&rsquo;s a completely custom web platform (no Wordpress or similar) which allowed us to create more useful travel guides than traditional blogs, and there&rsquo;s a lot going on under the hood:
 The frontend is written in Scala, transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS.
