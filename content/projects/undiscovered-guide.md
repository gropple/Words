[Undiscovered Guide](https://www.undiscoveredguide.com) is a travel website I created with my partner while we were travelling, to help others explore our favourite parts of the world.  It's pretty popular, getting over 30,000 monthly page views.

There's a lot going on under the hood:

* [Parts of it](https://www.undiscoveredguide.com/hanoi-street-food) are a dynamically-created single page app.  It's written in Scala, transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS.
* The backend CMS is custom and written from scratch in Scala.
* The CMS uses a custom HTML-like language, with its own handrolled parser.
