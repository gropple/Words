I've always been interested in 3D, and this is the start of an attempt to write a 3D engine in Java for learning purposes, based on OpenGL and ideally in an immutable function-programming style.

So far I've developed a basic-but-functioning 3D renderer, including support for shadows, lighting (directional & point-based), textures and models.  Like any renderer, it has help: it uses JAssimp for model loading, OpenGL via the LWJGL bindings for the drawcalls, and an image library for loading textures.  Everything else, including all the vector & matrix maths for model, camera and world transforms; the shaders (written in GLSL); and the lighting, colour and texture calculations, are all performed by the renderer.

The first finished project to drop out is a <b>3D model viewer</b>, in Java.  Check it out [on Github](https://github.com/programmatix/3DViewer), including the renderer source.

I've also written a <b>micro library for vector and matrix maths</b> in Scala, dorkily named Enter the Matrix.  There's a surprising lack of these, with the existing Scala matrix libraries being heavyweight, rather complex, and generally part of a much large statistical package.  I wanted something lightweight for 3D maths.  It's [available on Github](https://github.com/programmatix/EnterTheMatrix).
