An Android app, written in Scala and [published on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splitthebill&hl=en).

This app's not going to win any design or complexity awards, but was more of a successful hobby project to learn Android development and publish an app in a few days.

The [source is on Github](https://github.com/gropple/SplitTheBill).
