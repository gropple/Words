Hi!

These are some projects I've worked on recently - a mix of commercial and 'just for fun' stuff.

It's not intended to demo what a l33t coder I am.  I'm interested in so many areas of programming, and this site both gives me an outlet to explore, and encourages me to finish up personal projects and open source them.

Enjoy :)
