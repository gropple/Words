This desktop widget lets you control the web-based Google Play Music.

The widget is coded in Scala and uses ScalaFX for the UI.  There's also a Chrome extension, written in Javascript, which interacts with Google Play Music.  IPC between the two is with Websockets.

The [Chrome extension source](https://github.com/gropple/MiniPlayChrome) and [desktop widget source](https://github.com/gropple/MiniPlayDesktop) are on Github.
