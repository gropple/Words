## Undiscovered Guide
[Undiscovered Guide](https://www.undiscoveredguide.com) is a travel website I created with my partner while we were travelling, to help others explore our favourite parts of the world.  It's pretty popular, getting over 30,000 monthly page views.

It's a completely custom web platform (no Wordpress or similar) which allowed us to create more useful travel guides than traditional blogs, and there's a lot going on under the hood:

* The frontend is written in Scala, transpiled to Javascript with ScalaJS.  This convoluted approach let me do a lot of cool code sharing with the backend.
* [Parts of it](https://www.undiscoveredguide.com/hanoi-street-food) are a dynamically-created single page app.  There's all sorts of cool widgets such as interactive maps dotted over the site.
* There's a fairly complex backend content management system (CMS), written in Scala and with its own UI transpiled in ScalaJS.
* The CMS includes a custom HTML-like language, with its own handwritten parser.

## Smaller projects
* [One More Go](http://www.onemorego.net/) is a blog devoted to reviewing casual games, which I was briefly utterly addicted to.  It's on the Wordpress platform.
* This site is coded with the static site generator Hugo.  Static site generators are awesome: they're much faster and simpler than something like Wordpress, both for adding and consuming content.  The source is [on Github](https://github.com/gropple/Words) and it's hosted on Git Pages.
