Hi!  This is my personal website, with thoughts 'n' semi-broken projects and the like.

Visit it here [https://gropple.github.io/Words/projects/](https://gropple.github.io/Words/projects/).

## Developing
hugo server -D
http://localhost:1313/Words/

## Release Process
hugo
git add docs
git commit -a -m "Commit message"
git push

## Dev notes
hugo is setup to create the site in the docs directory, and Git Pages serves from this folder.
